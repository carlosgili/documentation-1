### Which version to use <a name="api_install"></a>

**Laravel 5.8**
```bash
composer require getcandy/candy-api
```

**Laravel 5.7**
```bash
composer require getcandy/candy-api "0.2.*"
```

<alert-panel level="warning" title="Hi">
  <div slot="title">0.2.* will only work with Elasticsearch 6.*</div>
</alert-panel>


Once done, publish the config.
```bash
$ php artisan vendor:publish --tag=config
```

### Migrations and Traits
Before we can use GetCandy we need to add the **HasCandy** trait to our userâ€¦


```php
<?
  namespace App;

  use GetCandy\Api\Core\Traits\HasCandy;

  class User extends Authenticatable
  {
      use HasCandy;
      // ...
  }
```

Now we are ready to install, run the install command:
```bash
php artisan candy:install
```

### Initialise the search index

```bash
php artisan candy:search:index
```

This will create the search index and get everything set up so we can start adding/searching products.

### Authentication
GetCandy uses Passport to deal with authentication, we just need to tell Laravel we want to use it for API authentication, so in `config/auth.php` the guards should look like this:

```php
'guards' => [
  'web' => [
    'driver' => 'session',
    'provider' => 'users',
  ],
  'api' => [
    'driver' => 'passport',
    'provider' => 'users',
  ],
],
```

### Link up storage
Make sure that you link up your storage directory if you are using the default asset storage.

```bash
$ php artisan storage:link
```

---
## Hub Installation <a name="hub_install"></a>

Make sure you're in the project root and run

```bash
$ composer require getcandy/candy-hub
```

Once done, publish the assets

```bash
$ php artisan vendor:publish --tag=public
```

That'be able to visit the hub by going to `/hub` and log in, there you will see the dashboard
